       <h1>Hey there, I'm Xue Beichen (薛北辰)! 👋</h1>
       <p>I'm a final-year undergraduate at the National University of Singapore (NUS), majoring in Data Science and Analytics. I want to unravel the complex ways humans interact with AI chatbots. 🤖💬</p>

       <p><em>Research</em>: <br>
              Ever wondered if AI is subtly influencing your thoughts? In my paper, <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=i0OmcF14Kf">"We Shape AI, and Thereafter AI Shapes Us: Humans Align With AI Through Social Influences,"</a> I explored how AI can shape human behavior through social mechanisms like contagion and conformity. 🧠🤝 

              Right now, I’m diving into how humans align their confidence with AI in decision-making. Imagine an AI confidently stating something—does that boost your trust, or make you second-guess yourself? My behavioral experiments show how AI-expressed confidence in natural language impacts human cognition. On top of that, I’m leading a research direction investigating how people unconsciously align their value systems with AI—because let’s face it, AI is becoming more than just a tool; it’s shaping society itself! ⚖️</p>
