        <p><em>Research</em> <br>
            Ever wondered if AI is subtly influencing your thoughts and behaviors? <br><br>

            In my paper, <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=64rCWVC78p">"We Shape AI, and Thereafter AI Shapes Us: Humans Align With AI Through Social Influences"</a>, I explored how AI can shape human behavior through social mechanisms such as contagion and conformity.  <br><br>

            Right now, I’m diving into how humans align their confidence with AI in decision-making. <br>
            Imagine an AI confidently stating something—does that boost your trust, or make you second-guess yourself? <br><br>

            My experiments show how AI's expressed confidence in natural language impacts human cognition and behavior in decision-making. <br><br>

            On top of that, I’m starting to investigate how people unconsciously align their value systems with AI. ⚖️
