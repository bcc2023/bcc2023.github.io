        <h1>Hey there</h1>
        <h1>I'm Xue Beichen (薛北辰)! 👋</h1>
        <p>I'm a final-year undergraduate at the National University of Singapore (NUS), majoring in Data Science and Analytics. I want to unravel the complex ways humans interact with AI chatbots. 🤖💬</p>

        <p><em>Research</em> <br>
            Ever wondered if AI is subtly influencing your thoughts and beheviors? <br><br>

            In my paper, <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=i0OmcF14Kf">"We Shape AI, and Thereafter AI Shapes Us: Humans Align With AI Through Social Influences,"</a> I explored how AI can shape human behavior through social mechanisms like contagion and conformity. 🧠🤝 <br><br>

            Right now, I’m diving into how humans align their confidence with AI in decision-making. <br>
            Imagine an AI confidently stating something—does that boost your trust, or make you second-guess yourself? <br><br>

            My experiments show how AI's expressed confidence in natural language impacts human cognition and behavior in decision-making. <br><br>

            On top of that, I’m starting to investigate how people unconsciously align their value systems with AI ⚖️
