            My research examines the subtle yet profound ways in which AI influences human cognition and behavior. <br><br>

            In paper <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=64rCWVC78p">"We Shape AI, and Thereafter AI Shapes Us: Humans Align With AI Through Social Influences"</a>, we discussed how AI can shape human decision-making through social mechanisms such as contagion and conformity. <br><br>

            Currently, I am exploring how humans align their confidence with AI in decision-making.  <br>

            Our experiments demonstrate how AI's confidence, conveyed through natural language, can influence human cognition and decision-making. <br><br>

            Additionally, Iâ€™m starting to investigate how people unconsciously align their value systems with AI.
